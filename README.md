# Hung-Yi's Advent of Code

These are solutions for the puzzles at https://adventofcode.com/

To get all solutions logged in the console: `npm start`.  
To run all tests: `npm test`

All puzzles have their main entry points at `./{year}/day{x}/{year}-day{x}.js`.

This means you can get solutions for a specific puzzle by running `node ./{year}/day{x}/{year}-day{x}.js`  
e.g. `node ./2015/day1/2015-day1.js`

And you can run tests for a particular puzzle by running `npm test {year}-day{x}`  
e.g. `npm test 2015-day1`
